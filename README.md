# ðŸ§  AI-SupplyShield ðŸ”’  
### AI-Based Real-Time Threat Analysis for Software Supply Chains  

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
**AI-SupplyShield** is an intelligent framework designed to **detect, analyze, and respond to software supply chain attacks in real time**.  
It leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** to profile the behavior of open-source packages and identify anomalies such as **Trojanized dependencies**, **typosquatting**, and **build-pipeline compromises**.

The project is part of a **Computer & Network Security** course focusing on AI-driven cybersecurity innovations.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Collect and preprocess open-source software telemetry and behavioral data.  
- Profile normal vs. malicious package behavior using ML/DL models.  
- Detect software supply-chain attacks such as:
  - Trojanized open-source dependencies  
  - Dependency confusion / typosquatting  
  - Build-pipeline injection attacks  
- Design and evaluate a **real-time anomaly detection pipeline**.  
- Implement **automated response simulation** (alert generation or quarantine).  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation
Modern software ecosystems depend heavily on third-party libraries and CI/CD automation.  
Attackers exploit this trust chain to inject malicious code during development or distribution â€” often **bypassing traditional firewalls and endpoint security tools**.

AI-SupplyShield aims to provide an **adaptive and intelligent defense** that continuously learns from behavior patterns and detects threats **before exploitation spreads through the supply chain**.

## ðŸ§  System Architecture

1. **Data Ingestion Layer** â€“ Collects and normalizes logs (system calls, network traces, install behavior).  
2. **Feature Extraction Layer** â€“ Derives behavioral features from package execution (I/O patterns, DNS queries, entropy, etc.).  
3. **ML/DL Detection Engine** â€“ Trains models (Autoencoder / LSTM / Isolation Forest) for anomaly classification.  
4. **Real-Time Monitor** â€“ Continuously analyzes new package installations or updates.  
5. **Automated Response Module** â€“ Flags, isolates, or logs suspicious activity.
